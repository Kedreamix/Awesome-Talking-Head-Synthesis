It contains over 35,000 sequences captured from 431 subjects ranging in age from 15 to 68 years old. Various sentences from scenarios such as news broadcasting, conversations and storytelling were recorded, totaling around 11,000 utterances. High-fidelity data was captured using three synchronized RGB-D cameras to obtain high-resolution 3D meshes and textures. A reconstruction pipeline was developed to fuse the multi-view data and generate topology-consistent 3D mesh sequences. In addition to the 3D facial motions, synchronized speech audio is also provided. The final dataset covers a wide range of expressive talking styles and facial expressions through a diverse set of subjects and utterances. With its large scale, high quality of data and strong diversity, the MMFace4D dataset provides an ideal benchmark for developing and evaluating audio-driven 3D facial animation models. |
| VFHQ                          | [Download link](https://liangbinxie.github.io/projects/vfhq) | Most of the existing video face super-resolution (VFSR) methods are trained and evaluated on VoxCeleb1, which is designed specifically for speaker identification and the frames in this dataset are of low quality. As a consequence, the VFSR models trained on this dataset can not output visual-pleasing results. In this paper, we develop an automatic and scalable pipeline to collect a high-quality video face dataset (VFHQ), which contains over **16,000 high-fidelity clips** of **diverse interview scenarios**. To verify the necessity of VFHQ, we further conduct experiments and demonstrate that VFSR models trained on our VFHQ dataset can generate results with sharper edges and finer textures than those trained on VoxCeleb1. In addition, we show that the temporal information plays a pivotal role in eliminating video consistency issues as well as further improving visual performance. Based on VFHQ, by analyzing the benchmarking study of several state-of-the-art algorithms under bicubic and blind settings. |
